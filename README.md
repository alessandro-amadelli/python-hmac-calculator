# PYTHON HMAC CALCULATOR
## python-hmac-calculator

### Purpose
This script let you generate an HMAC keyed hash for a file by inserting filename and hash key.
You can also compare the newly generated hash with an old one for the same file to tell if they are different.

This is useful if you want to be sure that no one modified the file since the last time you checked it.

### Instructions
1.  Create a file (or take an existing one)
2.  Run the script inserting file name and choosing a password (key)
3.  Save the generated hash
4.  Next time you want to check the file you just have to run the program again (2) inserting the key you chose the previous time
5.  After the program calculates hash, choose option "C"
6.  Insert the old hash and the script will compare them
